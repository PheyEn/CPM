      <p>Quantum algorithms can be roughly catogorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.</p>
      <p>There doesn't exist any mathematical proof that a classical algorithm can't match the computing speed of a quantum algorithm but evidence shows that it is unlikely to happen.</p>
      <p>Quantum algorithms include the aforementioned 'Shor's algorithm', which is a widely known quantum algorithm.  </p>
      <p>Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding prime factors in an integer. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of superpolynomial speedup compared to best known classical algorithms. </p>
      <p>The concerns for Shor's algorithm include that factoring numbers of practical significance require more qubits than available in the future. Another concern is that noise in quantum circuits may undermine results.</p>
      <p>Shor proposed multiple similar algorithms for solving the factoring problem, discrete logarithm problem and the period-finding problem. 'Shor's algorithm' usually refers to the factoring problem, but it can actually be referring of the 3 mentioned. The discrete logarithm and factoring problem are instances of the period-finding problem. While all 3 of them are instances of the hidden subgroup problem.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hidden subgroup problem(HSP) is a framework that captures problems such as the factoring, discrete logarithm, graph isomorphism, and the shortest vector problem. That makes it essential in the theory of quantum computing.
