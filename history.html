          <h2>The history of quantum computers.</h2>
          <p>It all originated from modern quantum theory which was developed in the 1920s, used to explain wave-particle duality observed at atomic scales. Thus leading to the creation of digital computers which paved the way to the removal of human computers due to human computers being incapable of doing tedious calculations for long periods of time.</p>
          <p>Physicists swapped out bits for qubits in quantum computing, thus quantum mechanics and computer science started to converge. In 1980, physicist Paul Benioff introduced the Quantum Turing Machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simple computer.</p>
          <p>Quantum algorithms emerged afterwards to solve oracle problems. Peter Shor used results from solved oracle problems, and built on them with "Shor's algorithm" to solve widely known and used encryption protocols, thus drawing a lot of attention to quantum computing.</p>
          <p>In 1998, a 2-qubit computer demonstrated the feasibility of technology.</p>

          <h2>Quantum computing during the 20s.</h2>
          <p>In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that any classical machine cannot replicate. However, the validity of this claim is still being researched.</p>
          <p>In December 2023, scientists from Harvard University successfully created "quantum circuits" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.</p>
