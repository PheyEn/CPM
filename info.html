      <p>Bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, while as a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information.</p>
      <p>A bit, by definition exists in two physical states. Which can be denoted to 0 and 1. A qubit is also described a state, often written as |0> and |1>. Those two serve as the quantum counterparts of the of the classical states of 0 and 1.</p>
      <p>The quantum states |0> and |1> belong to a vector space. This means that they can be multiplied by constants and added together. Such a combination is known as a superposition of |0> and |1>.</p>
      <p>A 2-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use Dirac's notation for linear algebra, writing |Ψ>. 'ket psi', for a vector labeled Ψ.</p>
      <p>A qubit is a 2-state system. Any qubit takes the form α|0> + ß|1> as its standard basis states. While α and ß are the probability amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers. If either α or ß is a zero, the qubit is essentially a classical bit. But when both are non-zero, the qubit is in superposition.
